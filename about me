    I studied Management and Entreprenurship while at univercity
    at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/ug/bsc-management-with-entrepreneurship/">Goldsmiths collage Univercity of London</a> where I achived a 2:1. While I was studying we focused on how technology would change the bussiness landscape and the skills we would need to become entreprenurs and change the future, this sparked my intrest in computers and code, while of course many 
    other areas are open to inovation it seemed obvious to me that a grounding in this feild is incresingly importent in todays world. </p>
